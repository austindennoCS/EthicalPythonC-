Summary
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<b>This guide explains the components of an ethical password cracker built using Python and C++ for educational purposes. It covers various methods and techniques employed to simulate real-world password cracking scenarios, emphasizing learning and understanding over malicious use.</b>
<h2 id="brute-force-and-dictionary-attacks">Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Brute-Force Attack:</b> Involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method helps students understand the time complexity and effort required to crack passwords of varying lengths and complexities.</li>
    <li><b>Dictionary Attack:</b> Uses a predefined list of likely passwords and attempts each one to find a match. This technique demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of using common password lists and highlights the importance of creating strong, unique passwords.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hybrid-attack">Hybrid Attack</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Hybrid Attack:</b> Combines elements of both brute-force and dictionary attacks to enhance the efficiency of the cracking process. It might start with a dictionary attack and then apply brute-force methods to modify or append characters to dictionary words, showing how combining methods can reduce the time required to crack a password.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multi-threading">Multi-threading</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Multi-threading:</b> Utilizes multiple threads to perform password cracking tasks simultaneously, significantly speeding up the process. This technique teaches students about parallel processing and how it can be used to optimize performance in computational tasks, demonstrating the power of concurrent execution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-metrics">Performance Metrics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Performance Metrics:</b> Measures and reports the time taken and the number of attempts for each method. This provides concrete data to analyze and compare the efficiency of different password cracking techniques, helping students understand the practical implications of password strength and the computational effort required to break them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<b>This educational tool provides a comprehensive understanding of password security and cracking methods. By simulating real-world scenarios through brute-force, dictionary, and hybrid attacks, and enhancing the process with multi-threading, students gain valuable insights into the importance of strong passwords and the techniques used to protect against cyber threats.</b>
